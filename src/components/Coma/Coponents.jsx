                <p>We used most popular and well managed open source components with bootstrap components.
                 Combined them into even more useful ones. Themed them with same design principles and created a design harmony between components and layouts.<br></br>
                From carousels to charts, switches to list we tried to provide components that we like to use on our development processes.</p>
